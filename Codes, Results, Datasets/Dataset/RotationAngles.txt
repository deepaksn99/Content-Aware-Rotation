The .txt files were obtained after using the Line Segment Detector 
that was mentioned in the paper. 
The output format is for simplicity.

The angles here mentioned are the angles by which the images are to be rotated in
the clockwise sense.


The angles were obtained from the paper itself.
The author Kaiming He has put up a link on the web from where the images were obtained.

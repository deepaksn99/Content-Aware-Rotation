1. Image Dataset is all the images thar are either of the .jpg or .png format. 
2. The .txt files with the name of the image as its prefix contains all
	the line segments that were detected using LSD_1.6 that I have
	attached as a part of my code. This Code has been cited already in the 
	report. This is used in the extractlines functions for further quantisation and 	bin assignment.
4. Rotation Angles.txt as of now has all the inputs that the user has to give to the program so that it works as per expectation.

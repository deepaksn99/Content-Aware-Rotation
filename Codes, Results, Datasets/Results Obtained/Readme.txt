Adaptive Rotation Plots 
1. It has all the plots pertaining to the rotation angles of the bins with respect
	to the actual rotation angle of the image. 

2. Fail Case
	This is the case where CAR failed to work - High angle of rotation.
3. Final Rotated Images
	This folder is the set of all the finally rotated images that I obtained
	using CAR.
4. Final Thetas
	CSV files that show the final rotation angle of the bins.
5. Final Vertices
	CSV files that show the final (post warped) vertex coordinates of the rotated image. 
6. Mesh Warping
	Consists of two folder that cover the initial mesh and the warped mesh.
7. Rotate and Crop Examples
	This contains the scenario how the image would look if rotated and cropped.
